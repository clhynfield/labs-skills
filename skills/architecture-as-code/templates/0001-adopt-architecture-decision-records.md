# ADR 0001 — Adopt Architecture Decision Records

## Context

This project uses an AI-assisted, agentic development workflow. Agents are
capable of proposing and implementing structural changes quickly — sometimes
faster than human reviewers can evaluate them. Several forces make that
combination risky without a deliberate gate:

**Hard-to-reverse decisions accumulate silently.** Choices about transport
protocols, API contracts, dependency boundaries, and data shapes are easy to
make and costly to undo. Without a written record of the constraints and
trade-offs that shaped a decision, future contributors (human or AI) will
re-litigate it uninformed, or worse, silently reverse it.

**Peer review of architectural changes is structurally different from code
review.** A code reviewer can evaluate whether an implementation is correct
given a direction. Evaluating whether the direction itself is appropriate
requires a different conversation — one that happens before the code exists,
not after.

**Agentic AI development warrants careful adoption.** AI agents can act at
speed and scale that outpaces the review bandwidth of small teams. Before
expanding agent autonomy (new capabilities, new tool categories, new
integration points), the team needs a lightweight mechanism for pausing,
examining, and explicitly accepting the decision rather than discovering it
in a diff.

## Decision

Adopt **Lightweight Architecture Decision Records** (LADRs), as described by
Michael Nygard in [*Documenting Architecture Decisions*][nygard] and
recommended by the [ThoughtWorks Technology Radar][twradar].

Records live in `docs/architecture/decisions/`, named
`NNNN-short-title.md` and numbered sequentially. Any architecturally
significant change **must** begin with an ADR in **Draft** status and be
reviewed and accepted before test or implementation code is written or
modified.

The lifecycle is:

| Status     | Meaning |
|------------|---------|
| Draft      | Proposed; under discussion. No implementation work yet. |
| Accepted   | Approved; guides current implementation. |
| Deprecated | Still implemented but no longer recommended for new work. |
| Superseded | Replaced by a later ADR (link it). |

ADRs are immutable once Accepted. Changes to a prior decision produce a new
ADR that supersedes the old one; the old record is updated only to add the
"Superseded by ADR NNNN" note.

ADRs are coupled to a living architecture overview in `docs/architecture/`.
**ADRs are to that overview as schema migrations are to a database schema:** the
overview always reflects the state implied by the last accepted ADR. An
architecturally significant change updates the overview (including its diagrams)
to the proposed state in the same change as the Draft ADR, and an ADR's status
is never changed without updating the relevant architecture docs in the same
commit. See `docs/architecture/README.md` for the conventions.

## Consequences

- Every significant structural decision has a written record of its context,
  rationale, and known trade-offs — legible to future contributors regardless
  of whether they were present for the discussion.
- Architectural changes in agentic workflows go through an explicit review
  gate. An agent that identifies a needed architectural change must draft an
  ADR and stop, rather than proceeding to implementation unilaterally.
- The overhead is intentionally small: a short Markdown file with free-form
  prose. The discipline is in the *sequence* (write first, implement after),
  not the volume of documentation.
- Accepted ADRs accumulate as a navigable history of why the project looks
  the way it does, while the architecture overview stays current as the
  single up-to-date picture of the system.
